Modified from [the original repo](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/tree/master/spring-boot-modules/spring-boot-react/src/main/java/com/baeldung/springbootreact) with SpringBoot + MyBatis + ReactJS. A detailed tutorial of the original repository can be found at [the link here](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-react-crud).

## Run this project

Make sure the Docker daemon is running on your machine, and simply run the script `run.sh` with the following command line.

```shell
sh run.sh
```

If there is no error, search `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you can access our Client List. If there is any error, consider solving the dependency issues.

Enjoy!
